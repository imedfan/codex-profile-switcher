# QuotaPilot

Tiny macOS 14+ menu bar app that manages **multiple OpenAI Codex accounts** and shows per-profile usage. Switch profiles without logging in again, track the quota windows Codex reports with reset countdowns. Auth stored in macOS Keychain. No Dock icon, no main window, just a menu bar dropdown.

## Why

- You have multiple Codex accounts (personal, work, client). Logging out and back in every time is painful. This app makes switching instant.
- Usage limits reset on rolling windows, and you can't see them for inactive accounts. This app tracks every saved profile, not just the active one.
- Auth lives in macOS Keychain. No telemetry, no cloud sync, no account linking.

## Features

- Manage multiple saved Codex profiles with custom labels
- See each quota window Codex reports for a saved profile, with its actual duration
- Show credit balance when Codex exposes it
- See Cursor Models (Cm) and Other Models (Om) quotas in a separate menu section
- Switch accounts without logging in every time
- Refresh inactive OAuth profiles so usage data stays current
- Renew stored credentials on a daily background schedule, before Codex reaches for its own refresh
- Keep the last known usage snapshot in the menu
- Launch at login
- Copy redacted debug info, open the log file, and jump to the GitHub issue form

## Privacy

The app reads and writes macOS Keychain items it creates, `~/.codex/auth.json`, and its own config at `~/.codex-switcher/config.json`. Codex usage is fetched through the Codex CLI; credential renewal sends the stored refresh token to `https://auth.openai.com/oauth/token` and saves the rotated token in the vault. The app does not read browser data or send telemetry.

For Cursor usage, the app opens `~/Library/Application Support/Cursor/User/globalStorage/state.vscdb` read-only and reads only `cursorAuth/accessToken` and `cursorAuth/cachedTeam`. The token is sent only to `https://api2.cursor.sh`, kept in memory for the refresh, and never saved or logged. HTTP redirects are rejected. Cursor's database, account, and spending settings are never changed.

## Cursor usage

Sign in to the Cursor desktop app, then open this app's menu. A separate **Cursor** card uses the same compact usage bars as Codex: **Cm** for Cursor Models and **Om** for Other Models. The countdown beside **Cm** shows the time until the billing cycle resets. Hover over a row for its full name. The **Limit display** preference applies to both rows; the menu bar always shows the QuotaPilot icon.

**Refresh**, menu-open refresh, wake refresh, and the configured polling schedule start updates for both services together. The single update line at the top covers both services and shows the oldest displayed snapshot. Cursor does not repeat the timestamp or display dollar amounts. Failed refreshes mark any last known Cursor usage; signing out or changing Cursor sessions clears its cached usage.

Cursor's usage endpoints are undocumented and may change. This integration uses the same `GetCurrentPeriodUsage` call as the Cursor desktop app: `planUsage.autoPercentUsed`, `planUsage.apiPercentUsed`, and `billingCycleEnd`. Missing percentages are treated as unavailable, never as zero. It does not switch Cursor accounts or renew their credentials. If the session expires, sign in again in Cursor and refresh.

## Install

For a personal build without Developer ID signing, run
`Scripts/package_local_app.sh` and copy `.build/local-app/QuotaPilot.app` to
`/Applications/QuotaPilot.app`. macOS may require **Open Anyway** in Privacy &
Security on first launch. This build uses the real `~/.codex/auth.json` and
stores saved profiles in `~/.codex-switcher/dev-auth-store` with private file
permissions. It cannot read profiles from the signed app's Keychain; sign in to
each profile once or migrate credentials from a file vault you already control.
Automatic updates and the signed build's daily renewal agent are unavailable.

Requires macOS 14+ and the [Codex desktop app](https://openai.com/codex/).

### GitHub Releases

Download the latest signed and notarized DMG from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/4LAU/codex-profile-switcher/releases), open
it, and drag `QuotaPilot.app` to Applications.

### Homebrew

Install via the [4lau/tap](https://github.com/4LAU/homebrew-tap):

```bash
brew install --cask 4lau/tap/codex-profile-switcher
```

### Build from Source

Building from source requires Xcode.app. The test and package scripts use SwiftPM targets under `Sources/` and set `DEVELOPER_DIR=/Applications/Xcode.app` when available.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/4LAU/codex-profile-switcher.git
cd codex-profile-switcher

./build.sh

# Start the loose app with an isolated home
CODEX_PROFILE_HOME="$HOME/.codex-profile-dev" codex-profile-switcher
```

The menu bar app is installed to `~/.local/bin/codex-profile-switcher`, and the
matching Swift CLI helper is installed to `~/.local/bin/codex-profile`.

**No Keychain prompts for source builds.** Released app bundles use the macOS
Data Protection Keychain, which lets the signed app and its bundled helper read
their shared saved profiles without per-account access-control prompts. Self-built
binaries never touch the real Keychain. When launching the loose menu app, set
`CODEX_PROFILE_HOME` or `CODEX_PROFILE_TEST_HOME` to a separate directory, as
shown above. The app stores its config and Codex data under that directory and
uses a file-based vault at `<home>/.codex-switcher/dev-auth-store` (0600 files,
the same protection Codex itself uses for `~/.codex/auth.json`). Without an
isolated home, the loose app hands startup to the signed app in `/Applications`
instead of opening production profile data. No Apple account or certificate is
needed, and no prompts appear.

Self-built CLIs are file-vault-only no matter how they are signed: reading the
shared Keychain profiles requires the Keychain Sharing entitlement, which only
the packaged app's bundled helper carries. Automation that needs the real
profiles should call that helper directly:

```
/Applications/QuotaPilot.app/Contents/Helpers/CodexProfileHelper.app/Contents/MacOS/codex-profile
```

`make install-cli APP_IDENTITY="..."` still has a use: it signs the loose CLI
with a stable identity so rebuilds keep the same signature instead of appearing
to macOS as a brand-new binary each time.

The helper finds the installed Codex Desktop bundle by its `com.openai.codex`
bundle identifier. This supports the current ChatGPT.app layout and the legacy
Codex.app layout. Set `CODEX_APP`, `CODEX_CLI`, or `CODEX_BUNDLED_CLI` when you
need to use an explicit installation or test fixture.

To build a signed app bundle instead of loose binaries:

```bash
Scripts/package_app.sh

# Optional Developer ID / Apple Development identity.
APP_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" Scripts/package_app.sh
```

Maintainer releases should use the DMG release flow in [docs/RELEASING.md](docs/RELEASING.md).

## Getting Started

Each profile needs one login before the app can switch to it.

Open Settings from the menu bar icon, select a profile, and click **Set Up**.
This opens Codex's normal browser login flow and saves the resulting auth in
macOS Keychain. After that, switching does not require logging in again.

You can also set up profiles from the terminal:

```bash
codex-profile login 1
codex-profile login 2
```

## Refresh

Open **Settings...** > **General** to choose how often the app refreshes usage:
**Manual**, **1 minute**, **2 minutes**, **5 minutes**, or **15 minutes**. The
default is 5 minutes. Manual turns off periodic refreshes only. You can still
refresh from the menu, and the normal launch, activation, wake, and profile
change refreshes still run.

**Refresh when the menu opens** is off by default. Turn it on if opening the
menu should also request fresh usage.

**Limit display** chooses what the percentages mean. **Used** (the default)
shows 0% for a full limit and 100% for an exhausted one; **Remaining**
reverses this, so 100% is a full limit and 0% is exhausted. It applies to the
Codex and Cursor usage bars in the dropdown.

Choose **Refresh** or press Command-R to update the open menu in place. The
menu stays open and the Refresh row is disabled until the work finishes. If a
refresh cannot get a current reading, the last successful reading stays visible
with an amber **Cached** marker.

## CLI Reference

The `codex-profile` helper manages profiles from the terminal.

```
codex-profile app <profile> [workspace]
codex-profile login <profile> [codex-login-args...]
codex-profile status [profile] [--json]
codex-profile list [--json]
codex-profile path <profile>
codex-profile doctor
codex-profile best-auth --dir <path> [--exclude <id1,id2,...>] [--json] [--non-interactive] [--timeout <seconds>]
codex-profile exec [--max-attempts <n>] [--exclude <id1,id2,...>] [--timeout <seconds>] -- <command> [args...]
codex-profile import-auth --dir <path> --profile <id> [--non-interactive] [--timeout <seconds>]
codex-profile renew [--profile <id>] [--force] [--dry-run] [--json] [--timeout <seconds>]
codex-profile lease begin [--exclude <id1,id2,...>] [--ttl <seconds>] [--timeout <seconds>] [--json] [--non-interactive]
codex-profile lease swap <token> [--exclude <id1,id2,...>] [--ttl <seconds>] [--timeout <seconds>] [--json] [--non-interactive]
codex-profile lease end <token> [--profile <id>] [--timeout <seconds>] [--non-interactive]
codex-profile lease gc
```

**Core commands**

- `login` — runs an isolated Codex login and saves the resulting auth to the Keychain.
- `app` — switches to a profile and relaunches Codex Desktop.
- `status` — shows auth state for one or all profiles. `--json` emits a JSON array.
- `list` — lists known profiles. `--json` emits a JSON array.
- `path` — prints the Keychain location for a profile.
- `doctor` — prints environment, installed Codex binaries, auth backend, and profile status.

### best-auth

Selects the profile with the most remaining quota and writes its credentials to `--dir`. Designed for scripted account rotation with `codex exec --ephemeral`.

Fetches live usage via `codex app-server` (bounded concurrency of 3) before ranking. Falls back to each profile's cached snapshot when a live fetch fails. Stores fresh snapshots back to the cache.

`best-auth --dir` is deprecated. It still behaves the same way, with the same exit codes and stdout, and now records a 24-hour lease for the exported credential. `lease gc` writes back a refreshed exported credential before reclaiming it. The command prints the deprecation notice on stderr so JSON callers can keep parsing stdout. Use `lease begin` for new scripts. This form will be removed in a future release. See [lease](#lease) below.

**Non-interactive behavior.** When stdin is not a terminal (CI, command substitution, cron), or when `--non-interactive` is passed, Keychain reads that would show a modal consent prompt are skipped instead of blocking. A global watchdog exits the process after `--timeout` seconds (default 30) to guarantee termination.

**Basic usage — bare profile ID on stdout:**

```bash
# Use in command substitution
PROFILE=$(codex-profile best-auth --dir /tmp/codex-session)
codex exec --ephemeral --dir /tmp/codex-session -- your-command
```

**JSON output:**

```bash
codex-profile best-auth --dir /tmp/codex-session --json
```

```json
{"candidates":[{"id":"personal","score":21,"snapshotAgeSeconds":47,"tier":"preferred"},{"id":"work","score":18,"snapshotAgeSeconds":14,"tier":"preferred"}],"fetched":true,"score":18,"selected":"work","tier":"preferred"}
```

**Excluding profiles:**

```bash
# Exclude a profile known to be rate-limited
codex-profile best-auth --dir /tmp/codex-session --exclude work
```

**Exit codes:**

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Profile selected and credentials written |
| 1 | Generic failure |
| 2 | No eligible profile (all excluded or exhausted) |
| 3 | No profiles configured |
| 4 | Usage data unavailable (no live fetch succeeded, no cached snapshots) |
| 6 | Keychain interaction required — run `codex-profile best-auth` once from a terminal to grant access |
| 7 | Watchdog timeout |

### exec

Runs any command with `CODEX_HOME` pointed at the best profile's credentials, with automatic rotation on usage limits. This is the one-line replacement for hand-rolled `best-auth` / `mark-exhausted` / `import-auth` loops:

```bash
codex-profile exec -- codex exec --ephemeral -C "$(pwd)" - < prompt.md
```

Per attempt (up to `--max-attempts`, default 3):

1. Selects the profile with the most remaining quota (same logic and exit codes as `best-auth`) into a private temp directory.
2. Runs the command with `CODEX_HOME` pointing there. stdin and stdout pass through untouched; stderr passes through and is also scanned.
3. On success, writes refreshed tokens back to the profile (identity-guarded) and exits 0.
4. If the command failed and its stderr matches a usage-limit error (`rate limit`, `usage limit`, `429`, `quota exceeded`, `too many requests`), the profile is marked exhausted for an hour and the command retries on the next best profile. Any other failure exits immediately with the child's exit code. Detection scans stderr only — a limit message printed exclusively to stdout is not detected, because stdout streams through verbatim.

The live `~/.codex` is never touched, so a running Codex Desktop/CLI session is unaffected. Selection failures use the `best-auth` exit codes (2/3/4/6); a selection watchdog (`--timeout`, default 60s) covers only the selection phase, never the wrapped command.

### import-auth

Writes a refreshed `auth.json` from `--dir` back to the stored credential for `--profile`. Intended as the write-back half of a `best-auth` rotation loop — or just use `exec`, which does the full loop for you.

**Identity guard.** Before overwriting, `import-auth` compares the identity fingerprint of the existing stored credential against the incoming file. If they belong to different accounts the write is refused and the command exits 5. This prevents a credential for one account from silently overwriting a different account's profile.

**Headless mode.** `--non-interactive` skips the interactive Keychain-repair step, which can otherwise stall a headless process on a modal consent prompt, and reads the existing credential through the fail-closed vault. `--timeout <seconds>` arms a watchdog so the call always terminates. This is the write-back path `lease end` uses.

```bash
codex-profile import-auth --dir /tmp/codex-session --profile work
```

Exit code 5 means the refreshed credential belongs to a different account. All other failures exit 1.

### lease

`exec` wraps a single command. When you need one Codex session to stay open across many turns (an agent loop, a long review), `lease` holds an account open and rotates it underneath the session when a limit hits, so the session never restarts and never re-reads the repo.

```bash
read -r CHOME TOKEN < <(codex-profile lease begin --json | jq -r '"\(.home) \(.token)"')
export CODEX_HOME="$CHOME"
trap 'codex-profile lease end "$TOKEN"' EXIT

cd "$REPO"
codex exec -C "$REPO" - < prompt.md          # first turn reads the repo

# ...a usage limit hits mid-session...
codex-profile lease swap "$TOKEN"            # next-best account, same home
codex exec resume --last - < followup.md     # still warm, no repo re-read
```

- `begin` — reserves the profile with the most remaining quota (same logic and exit codes as `best-auth`), seeds a private throwaway `CODEX_HOME`, and records the reservation so a second run never grabs the same account. Prints the home path, or `{profile, home, token, expires_at}` with `--json`. The reservation lasts `--ttl` seconds (default 3600), a backstop in case the process dies without releasing it.
- `swap <token>` — the leased account hit a limit. `swap` writes its refreshed credential back, marks it exhausted for an hour, and drops the next-best account into the same home. The session files under `sessions/` are left alone, so a `codex exec resume` stays warm.
- `end <token>` — writes the refreshed credential back to its profile and tears the lease down. It is idempotent and trap-safe: wire it to a shell `trap` and a second call, or a call after the work already finished, is a clean no-op. Pass `--profile <id>` to assert the lease still belongs to the account you expect before writing.
- `gc` — deletes expired lease homes and reclaims any home a crashed run left behind. `begin` calls it opportunistically, so you rarely run it yourself.

Reservations live in the shared usage cache, and any account holding one is skipped by `best-auth`, `exec`, and other `lease begin` calls. Every write to that cache goes through a cross-process lock, so two agents reserving and releasing accounts at the same moment cannot drop each other's reservations or strand a refreshed credential.

`--non-interactive` and `--timeout` behave as they do for `best-auth`: skip Keychain prompts that would block a headless run, and guarantee the call exits. Selection exit codes match `best-auth` (2 no eligible profile, 3 no profiles configured, 4 usage unavailable, 6 keychain interaction required).

### renew

Codex can leave a credential unchanged while it is working and reach for its own refresh only after the credential is stale. Several refresh attempts can then carry the same single-use refresh token. A replay can revoke the token chain, leaving the account needing an interactive login. `renew` refreshes OAuth credentials ahead of that point, after three days of staleness.

```bash
codex-profile renew [--profile <id>] [--force] [--dry-run] [--json] [--timeout <seconds>]
```

Renewal makes one request per credential. Profiles that share a refresh token are one credential group, so `--profile <id>` renews the whole group. A credential held by an active `exec`, `lease`, or `best-auth --dir` export is skipped. `--force` ignores the age threshold. `--dry-run` writes nothing.

Exit code 0 means the command ran. It does not mean every profile was renewed. A profile can be skipped, so automation must inspect the per-profile record. With `--json`, stdout contains one object:

```json
{"records":[{"action":"renewed","age_days":3.0421,"credential":"f0f0f0f0f0f0","id":"work","reason":"renewed"}],"requests":1}
```

Each record has `id`, `action`, `reason`, `age_days`, and `credential`. `action` is `renewed`, `skipped`, `rejected`, `unreachable`, or `recovered`. `credential` is a short fingerprint, not the token. Match on `action` rather than `reason`: a run that discarded a stale recovery file prefixes `reason` with `stale_stash_discarded;`. `requests` counts HTTP requests and is per credential, not per profile. `--timeout` accepts positive seconds up to 3600 and defaults to 120.

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | The command ran. Inspect records for skipped profiles. |
| 1 | Generic failure, including an unknown flag, a missing or invalid value, or a credential that changed underneath the renewal. |
| 2 | The profile named by `--profile` does not exist. |
| 5 | A stored credential belongs to a different account than the one that was renewed. That credential was left unchanged; other credential groups in the same run may already have been renewed. |
| 6 | Keychain interaction required. Run the command once from a terminal to grant access. |
| 7 | Watchdog timeout. |
| 8 | The server rejected a credential. An interactive login is required. |
| 9 | The token endpoint was unreachable. |

The signed app registers a background launchd agent through `SMAppService`. The agent launches `codex-profile renew` once a day and exits. It is not a resident process, and it runs while the menu bar app is closed. The bundled plist is at `Contents/Library/LaunchAgents/` and is named `com.4lau.codex-profile-switcher.renew.plist`. Its schedule is 03:00 every day.

Open **Settings...** > **General** and check **Credential renewal**. It should say **Scheduled**. If it says **Not scheduled** because macOS is waiting for approval, open **System Settings** > **General** > **Login Items** and approve the background item. An unapproved agent does not run.

If it says **Unavailable**, update to 0.5.20 or later. Releases 0.5.19 and earlier misread the "never registered on this Mac" state as a missing plist and refused to register, so the daily job was never scheduled and renewal ran only when the app was launched. Approving a Login Item does not fix that one.

For headless use, install the app and register a LaunchAgent of your own:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <key>Label</key>
  <string>com.example.codex-profile-renew</string>
  <key>ProgramArguments</key>
  <array>
    <string>/Applications/QuotaPilot.app/Contents/Helpers/CodexProfileHelper.app/Contents/MacOS/codex-profile</string>
    <string>renew</string>
  </array>
  <key>StartCalendarInterval</key>
  <dict>
    <key>Hour</key>
    <integer>3</integer>
    <key>Minute</key>
    <integer>0</integer>
  </dict>
  <key>RunAtLoad</key>
  <false/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

Save that as `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.codex-profile-renew.plist` and load it with `launchctl bootstrap gui/$UID ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.example.codex-profile-renew.plist`. If the app is installed and has been launched at least once, it registers the same daily job itself, so a hand written agent is a second 03:00 run. That is harmless: whichever run starts second finds the credential reserved and reports `skipped`.

Use `StartCalendarInterval` for this daily job. If the calendar time arrives while the Mac sleeps, macOS runs the job when the Mac wakes. A LaunchAgent runs only inside a logged-in user session, so a Mac sitting at the login window does not renew. A Mac that stays powered off for more than ten days can come back with credentials that are already dead. Nothing running locally can prevent that; an interactive sign-in is required.

## How It Works

Codex Desktop still runs against its normal `~/.codex/` directory. This project
stores per-profile auth in macOS Keychain and swaps the selected profile into
`~/.codex/auth.json` when you switch.

When you switch profiles, the helper:

1. Quits the running Codex instance
2. Saves the outgoing live auth back to the matching stored profile
3. Restores the selected profile's saved auth to `~/.codex/auth.json`
4. Relaunches Codex normally

For usage data, the app fetches quota via `codex app-server` in a temporary
profile-scoped environment. The same path is used by the CLI's `best-auth`
command when it self-fetches usage before ranking.

## macOS Permissions

The app stores auth tokens in the Data Protection Keychain. Signed releases use
an Apple-authorized storage group shared by the app and bundled helper, so
ordinary profile switches do not need a per-account Keychain approval prompt.

After upgrading from an older release, open Settings > General and review any
legacy Keychain copies before moving them. The app lists the affected profiles
and does not remove the old copies unless you confirm that exact list.

## Troubleshooting

Open `Settings...` > `General` for built-in support tools:

- Copy Debug Info copies app state plus recent redacted logs to the clipboard.
- Open Log opens `~/Library/Logs/CodexProfileSwitcher/CodexProfileSwitcher.log`.
- Report Bug opens the GitHub issue form.

Logs redact emails, bearer tokens, cookies, API keys, and OAuth fields before writing. From the terminal, `codex-profile doctor` prints a quick environment and saved-profile check.
